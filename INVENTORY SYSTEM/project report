The aim of the project is to write a python code that will keep track of items in a store,how many items have been sold,when the store needs to be restocked (which item(s) needs to be restocked) and make a prediction on future demand of the products in the store.

The system will have two interfaces 1).for the admin 2).for the customer.

On the admin interface,on will have the athentication to:
       a).View user information(which item(s) he/she bought,when he bought and how much money spent).
       b).view which items are in the store's dataset.
       c).Add new item(s) in the store's dataset
       d).Remove item(s) in the store dataset.
       e).view which item(s) needs to be restocked
       f).See which items will be in demand

On customer interface,one will have the authentication to:
       a).See available products in the store,their price and quantity
       b).Purchase through the interface
